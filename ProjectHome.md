<strong>Notes</strong>: We are grateful to the American Psychological Association, publisher of the edited book, Single-Case Intervention Research: Methodological and Statistical Advances (Kratochwill & Levin, 2014), for kindly allowing us to make available the following excerpted material. We are also grateful to Thomas Kratochwill, University of Wisconsin–Madison, to John Ferron, University of South Florida, and to Robert Horner, Kent McIntosh, and their students in a single-case design-and-analysis course at the University of Oregon, for their helpful suggestions about how to increase the user friendliness of the ExPRT programs.<br>

The single-case data-analysis ExPRT (Excel® Package of Randomization Tests), developed by Boris S. Gafurov (George Mason University) and Joel R. Levin (University of Arizona and University of Wisconsin-Madison), is a set of Microsoft Office 2010 Excel®-based programs for conducting randomization and permutation statistical tests in a wide variety of single-case intervention designs. The macros that are required to conduct ExPRT analyses may or may not be operational with various Mac Office versions of Excel®. We wish to thank Tom Kratochwill and Jennifer Asmus for providing financial assistance that helped to create new randomization-test routines for Version 2.0 of ExPRT. In addition to this expanded “User’s Guide,”Version 2.0 has incorporated Levin, Ferron, and Gafurov’s  (2015a) “restricted” randomization-test procedure for the multiple-baseline design, along with a stand-alone randomizer routine that returns intervention start points conforming to a minimum between-case stagger specified by the user. Because ExPRT is continually being updated, its developers would appreciate users who encounter any suspected program errors or bugs to report them to Joel Levin at <a href='mailto:jrlevin@u.arizona.edu'>jrlevin@u.arizona.edu</a>.<br>
